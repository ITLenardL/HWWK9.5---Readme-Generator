# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator
Tasked to create a readme generator with node, it should prompt questions and provide a generated readme from the supplied answers.
We will use the package called [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to create prompts in nodejs.

# How to use application
```bash
node index.js
```
- Then answer prompted questions

# Problems
Due to the week being rushed and now an even steeper learning curve for the code, writing the correct function takes a lot longer to make it work. Having gotten advice on an activity we did during class from a tutor greatly helped me have a base of what to begin with and how to structure my inquirer prompts and the functions that take in the answers. Had many issues getting it to work exactly as node isn't as easy to identify faults in as html/css/js is. One of the better understood exercises for homework and apps to create, given more time I would have explored including more functionality and dynamic answers.
